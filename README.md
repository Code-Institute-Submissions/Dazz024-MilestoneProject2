# Milestone Project 2 - Dazz's Games
This website will allow people to play a simon says memory game where by they can read up a little about memory and the science behind it and allows them to train their memory and
have fun trying to beat their high score. It will store their high scores locally so they share their results on social media buttons at the footer of the page. The main goal is to have fun

## User Experience
### User Stories
User 1 - aged 30 wants:
* To have a fun game to play.

* To be able to share their scores.

User 2 - aged 16 wants:

* To see store their current high score.
* The game to have increasing difficulty.

## Design
* I main colour scheme is going to be dark blue and white to make it seem professional but still have a bit of colour and fun to it.
* The two fonts I will be using is PT Sans for the main body and for any big logo headings or big eye catching titles I will use Goldman.
* I have picked out good imagery which will catch the eye of the user which is why I have picked more dull background colours.
