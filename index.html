                        Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. It is the retention of information 
                        over time for the purpose of influencing future action. If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, 
                        or personal identity to develop. Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia. 
                        <br><br>
                        Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, 
                        short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory. This can be related to the neuron. The sensory processor allows information from the outside 
                        world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding 
                        and retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor. 
                        The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material. Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various 
                        categorical models or systems.

                        Memory is something you can train over time. It will become very useful in life at it allows you remember things you might not have previously
                        if you hadn't trained your memory. You can have some people out there who don't need to train it because they have photographic memories! Some of you
                        may be so lucky. However, if you keep training your brain to be better and better at remembering stuff then you might almost have a photographic memory.
                         You can see people like the great chess Grandmasters such as Magnus Carlsen have great memories as they can play 10 games of chess simultaneously while
                         blindfolded! Or even people like Lebron James who can remember specific plays in specific minutes of the basketball games he's played in! Incredible!
                         Use our memory games to help you get started on becoming a master at remembering everything so you will never forget anything again! They scale from <a href="easy.html">easy</a>,
                          <a href="medium.html">medium</a> and <a href="hard.html">hard</a> levels. Work your way up to having a strong memory.
